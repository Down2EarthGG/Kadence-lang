# Kadence VS Code Extension

Official language support for **Kadence** — the poetic programming language.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Syntax Highlighting
Full-color syntax highlighting for `.kade` files, custom-tailored to separate "poetic" keywords from standard logic.

### 🌓 Custom Theme: "Kadence Night"
Includes a carefully crafted dark theme designed to match the language's aesthetic.
- **Background**: Deep slate/navy (`#0f172a`)
- **Keywords**: Soft indigo & violet
- **Strings**: Vibrant emerald
- **Activation**: `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T` -> Select **Kadence Night**

### 🧩 Intelligent Snippets
Type less, write more poetry. usage examples:
- `if` → Expands to a full `if ... end` block
- `match` → Creates a `match ... when ... else` structure
- `class` → Scaffolds a class with constructor
- `http` → Quick templates for `get`, `post`, etc.

### 🔬 Error Checking
Basic semantic analysis to catch common errors while you type.

### 📚 Standard Library Support
First-class highlighting and autocomplete for the entire Kadence standard library, from `array` and `async` to `url` and `uuid`.
